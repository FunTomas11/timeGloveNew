Glove of time
======================

### What it is?

A glove that may surprise the humanities and your grandmother.
Able to visually accelerate, decelerate or even stop the movement of objects with a constant speed by rotating the hand.


### How it works?

This effect is achieved using the stroboscope effect. By adjusting the frequency of the flashing light, we can choose the moment at which the object is illuminated in the same position. Due to imperfect human vision, we will observe the effect of slowing down time.

### What you need?

The project consists of simple components: 
* step-up converter 
* mosfet transistor 
* gyroscope module 
* 100-watt LED 
* Arduino nano.
